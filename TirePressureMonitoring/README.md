Tire Monitoring System
======================
This kata was originally designed by Luca Minudel and published here on github (https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples) as part of his research into TDD and Design Principles. See also Emily Bache's [repository](https://github.com/emilybache/Racing-Car-Katas) for additional implementations.

Context
=======
Imagine you have just started a new job working on the software systems for a Formula 1 racing team. You have inherited some code that you would characterize as legacy, and you now want to write unit tests for it. Much of the code fails to follow one or more of the SOLID principles, and this makes it more difficult.

Directions
==========
Write the unit tests for the Alarm class; refactor the code as much as you need to make the class testable.

The Alarm class is designed to monitor tire pressure and set an alarm if the pressure falls outside of the expected range. The Sensor class provided for the exercise simulates the behavior of a real tire sensor, providing random but realistic values.
