# Triangle Type
This problem is based on the self-assessment test from "The Art of Software Testing, 2nd Edition" by Glenford J. Myers (2004).

Implement a set of test cases to the test the core functionality of following program properly:

> The program reads three integer values from an input dialog. The three values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program displays a message that states whether the triangle is scalene [all sides have different lengths], isosceles [two sides have the same length], or equilateral [all sides have the same length].
